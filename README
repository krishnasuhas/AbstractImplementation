Implementation of abstractions from scratch in Java:-

A) These files implement some basic abstractions in java like:-

 1)Array,

 2)Nested Sequences for storing both default data types and user defined datatypes,

 3)Mapings of data for Keyvalue pairs,



B) all of these are implemented from scratch just by using integer and character datatypes and inheritance, binding features in java.

Once created these abstarctions theses files also contains the operations on these datatypes like:-

1) deep copying and 
 
2)flattening the nested sequence.


C)Created iterators for all the above implemented for accessing and modifying easily.


D)sequences are implemented both in one two dimensions with nesting feature.


E)Mapping the give sequence of different datatypes with onother sequence so that if any variable present in one of the comparing sequence. that variable get the value of counterpart.
